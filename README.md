Green Cloud Computing: Energy Optimization Demo
This project presents an energy-efficient resource allocation system for sustainable cloud computing. 

🎮 Interactive Live Simulation

Real-time visualization of 8 physical servers
Dynamic VM workload fluctuations
Color-coded server status (Active/Sleep/Overloaded)
Workload trend analysis

🔬 Algorithm Comparison
Compare four consolidation strategies:

Static Threshold: Fixed resource allocation
Reactive: Responds after threshold violations
Proactive (LSTM): Predicts and acts before congestion
Hybrid (LSTM-DQN): Our proposed intelligent approach
